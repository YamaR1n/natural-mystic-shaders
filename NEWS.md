# Release notes

## 1.9.1 -- not released yet

* Improved compatibility with GLSL ES implementations where fragment
  shaders don't support ``highp`` (#86).
* Replace all use of ``TIME`` with ``TOTAL_REAL_WORLD_TIME`` (#87).
* Added a configuration item ``ENABLE_CAMERA_MOVEMENT_MITIGATION``
  which is disabled by default. It mitigates the problem where the
  animation of water and leaves move along with players, but has a
  side effect of causing a discontinuity when a player crosses chunk
  borders (#85).

## 1.9.0 -- 2021-05-09

* Updated the base code from 1.16.0 to 1.16.221.
* Implemented shaders for shader-generated sun and moon (#52). The
  moon shader does a diffuse lighting to render lunar phases.
* Added a configuration item ``ENABLE_SHADER_SUN_MOON`` which is
  enabled by default. Disabling it will revert the sun and the moon to
  the default texture-based rendering.
* The waving animation of plants used to happen even indoors. It is
  now fixed (#85).
* The waving animation of plants used to have a discontinuity at each
  of chunk borders. It is now fixed too (#85).
* The perturbance of water also significantly decreases indoors now.

## 1.8.0 -- 2020-06-25

The 1.16.0 nether upgrade surprisingly didn't break my shaders too
much so this is only a small fix and an improvement.

* Updated the base code from 1.9.0 to 1.16.0.
* Fixed an issue with Minecraft Bedrock 1.16.0: Water in a swampland
  was sometimes not detected and was rendered in the vanilla way.
* Added a configuration item ``ENABLE_FANCY_WATER`` which is enabled
  by default. Now you can leave water unmodified by the shader if you
  wish.

## 1.7.0 -- 2019-02-20

* Updated the base code from 1.8.0 to 1.9.0.
* The shader now abuses ambient occlusion factor to create more
  shadows, especially on the sides of blocks. It can be disabled via a
  configuration item ``ENABLE_OCCLUSION_SHADOWS``.
* Fixed the direction of reflected sunlight which wasn't parallel to
  the sun.
* Added a thin fog that always affects the scene, not only when it's
  raining. Its color and density is currently constant although it
  should ideally be biome-specific (#9). It can be disabled via a
  configuration item ``ENABLE_BASE_FOG``.
* Grass, fern, and vines now have a waving animation (#11). Other
  plants still don't wave though.
* Fixed the configuration item ``ENABLE_WAVES`` not working properly.
* Added a configuration item ``ENABLE_SPECULAR`` so you can disable
  specular lighting which might be laggy.
* Added a configuration item ``ENABLE_RIPPLES`` so you can disable a
  water ripple animation that appears on the ground when it rains.

## 1.6.0 -- 2019-01-30

* Reworked the water again. Now it has a darker base color and shows
  reflected sunlight and moonlight. Note that the direction of
  sunlight doesn't always match to the actual position of the sun due
  to a limitation in the current rendering engine.
* When it's raining the ground now looks wet (#49).
* Changed the color of rain drops so they look more whitish.

## 1.5.0 -- 2019-01-21

* Reworked the water completely. Now it has much more convincing waves
  and specular highlights.
* Clouds now have highlights and shade.
* Shadows no longer disappear all of a sudden when it starts raining
  (#40).

## 1.4.0 -- 2019-01-14

* Fixed vanilla clouds being shown when "Fancy Graphics" is disabled.
* The scene no longer becomes unplayably dark when underwater or in
  The End.
* Moonlight no longer affects the scene on a rainy night.
* The color of the ambient light is no longer a constant white. It now
  changes depending on the terrain-dependent sunlight level and the
  time-dependent daylight level. That is, when in an occluded area
  like a cave, the only possible light sources are torches so the
  color of ambient light resembles that of torch light. Likewise, when
  on the ground of the Overworld, either the color of the sun or the
  moon will affect the ambient depending on the in-game time.
* Changed the fog type from linear fog (vanilla) to exponential
  squared fog (#12). It is slightly more expensive but produces better
  results.
* Distant terrain is now rendered with gradually reduced contrast to
  express a light scattering effect caused by particles flowing in the
  air (#5).
* Cluster of torches no longer flicker in a synchronized manner (#48).

## 1.3.0 -- 2019-01-06

* Clouds are now slightly brighter at night.
* Introduced a randomness in the brightness of stars.
* Torches now flicker more randomly and slightly more intensely.
* Overhauled the entire lighting passes in the terrain shader. Now it
  computes light levels and colors completely differently. This was
  inevitable to improve lights and fix bugs listed below:

    * The intensity of the ambient light now slightly increases when
      it's foggy (#32).
    * The scene no longer becomes reddish as if it were in the sunset,
      when it rains during the daytime (#24).
    * Dark areas, especially caves, no longer become strangely
      brighter when it rains.
    * Shadows are now much less dense at night.

## 1.2.0 -- 2018-12-31

Enhancements:

* Added fake specular light for water and improved its wave. The
  opacity of water surface now changes depending on the angle between
  the camera and the surface. There is still a room for improvement in
  the specular light though. (#10)

Bugfixes:

* Lava pools in the Nether no longer look strangely whitish. (#30)
* Performance improvement for clouds.
* Fixed the color and the intensity of ambient light being calculated
  incorrectly.
* Shadows no longer disappear completely when it rains. It still fades
  suddenly and we're looking for a way to fix it. (#33)
* The animation speed of leaves no longer accelerate when the camera
  is moving. Water still has the same issue but we don't know how to
  fix it. (#36)

## 1.1.0 -- 2018-12-26

Enhancements:

* The scene now looks duller under a bad weather condition. (#6)
* Added waves for water and leaves, but not plants due to a limitation
  in the current rendering system. (#10, #11)
* Replaced clouds with non-blocky, shader-generated one.

## 1.0.0 -- 2018-12-22

The first release.
