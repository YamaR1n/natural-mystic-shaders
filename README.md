## Changing configuration

Ideally there should be an in-game GUI to dynamically control the
settings of shaders, but that isn't possible at the moment
([#44](https://github.com/depressed-pho/natural-mystic-shaders/issues/44)). To
compensate this shader pack contains a configuration file so users can
edit it directly to modify its behavior.

* Unpack the `.mcpack` file to some directory. It's just a zip archive.
* Open `src/shaders/glsl/natural-mystic-config.h` with your favorite editor.
* Edit the file to change configuration.
* Archive it again, and install it.

For example, you can disable the shader-generated clouds and turn it
into the default by changing the following line:

```glsl
#define ENABLE_FBM_CLOUDS 1
```

To this:

```glsl
//#define ENABLE_FBM_CLOUDS 1
```
